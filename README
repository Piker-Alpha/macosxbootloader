This Github project is a fork of: https://code.google.com/p/macosxbootloader


PROJECT GOALS

The initial goal of this project was to fix the OS X 10.10 (Yosemite) incompatibility issues for the 2006/2007 MacPro models, 
but it should work just as well with any other Mac models with a 32-bit only EFI implementation. 


PROJECT DEVELOPMENT

This project is maintained by Pike R. Alpha (https://pikeralpha.wordpress.com)

Bugs can be reported here: https://github.com/Piker-Alpha/macosxbootloader/issues

The current state is: Completed (OS X 10.10 Yosemite is now fully supported).


PROJECT IDEAS

There is a whole lot more that could be done, and here are some ideas:

- Add a ACPI patcher.

- Add a SMBIOS patcher.

- Add Kernel/Kext patcher.

- Add a GUI for FileVault.

- Implement Internet Recovery.

- Build project with Xcode.

- Cleanup source code.

- Fix boot time (too long now).
